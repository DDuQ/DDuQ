### Hi there, I'm Esteban <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/929656222792167455.gif?size=96&quality=lossless" height=40>

I’m a software developer from Colombia specializing in backend development with Microsoft technologies. I love writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me swimming, gaming, or admiring capybaras. Always learning, always building.

#### Fun fact:
- Capybaras are my favorite animal in the world. <br/>
